## Installation
*This repo houses 3 separate folders. `Serverpack`, `server` & `client` each explained respectively.*
- `Server Pack`: This is the easiest way to setup a server. All you need to do is setup a forger server and drop these mods in the `mods` folder.
- `Mods`: These are mods that the user should have in their local mods folder but should also be loaded onto the server.
- `Note`: The `mods` folder should at-least contain all mods in the `Mods` Section of this repo while the server should ONLY contain `Server Pack`
